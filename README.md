# Snakes and Ladders

Welcome to our Snakes and Ladders game! This project was developed as part of a school assignment to learn about using UML (Unified Modeling Language) for planning code and implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game provides a simple, yet classic board game experience, where players navigate a board filled with snakes and ladders, aiming to reach the finish line first.

## Project Overview

This Snakes and Ladders project was designed to practice OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while also emphasizing proper planning and design using UML diagrams. We created UML diagrams to visualize the structure of our code and the relationships between classes, which helped us write clean, maintainable code.

### Features
- **Two or more players**: The game can be played by multiple players, with a minimum of two.
- **Random dice rolls**: Players roll a virtual die to move across the board.
- **Snakes and Ladders**: Landing on a ladder takes you up the board, while landing on a snake takes you down.
- **OOP Principles**: The game was built using OOP principles, such as:
  - **Classes**: Player, Board, Dice, GameController, etc.
  - **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes.
  - **Inheritance**: Some classes inherit behavior from parent classes where applicable.
  - **Polymorphism**: Methods are designed for flexibility and reusability.

### UML Design

Before implementation, we used UML diagrams to plan the game structure:
- **Class Diagram**: Represents the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships between the components in our game.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Demonstrates the flow of the game, showing how players interact with the system and how objects collaborate during gameplay.

### Getting Started

To run the Snakes and Ladders game:
1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the project to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Compile the code**: Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
3. **Run the game**: Run the main class using `java SnakesAndLadders`.

### How to Play
1. Each player takes turns to roll the dice by pressing Enter.
2. Players move forward based on the dice roll.
3. Landing on a ladder moves the player up, while landing on a snake moves the player down.
4. The first player to reach or exceed the final square wins the game!

### Lessons Learned
- **Planning with UML** helps avoid confusion during coding by giving a clear visual guide.
- **OOP Principles** make the code easier to extend, modify, and maintain.

### Future Improvements
- **GUI Version**: Develop a graphical interface to make the game more interactive and visually appealing.
- **Custom Board Sizes**: Allow users to select different board sizes for varied gameplay.
- **Enhanced Rules**: Add additional rules or variations to make the game more challenging.

### Acknowledgments
We'd like to thank our instructor for guiding us through the process of UML planning and OOP design. The classic Snakes and Ladders game provided an enjoyable way to apply what we learned in a hands-on project.
